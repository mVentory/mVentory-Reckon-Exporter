1. Install QODBC.
2. Configure QODBC data source the console application will be using.
   - Go to All Programs > QODBC Driver > Configure QODBC Data Source.
   - Go to "System DNS" tab.
   - Add new data source and select "QODBC Driver for Quickbooks".
   - In the "General" tab, enter the data source name (DSN).
   - You can leave the other default options.
3. Enter the data source name in step #2 in the "QuickbooksExporter.exe.config" file (this is the app.config) into the "OdbcDsn" setting.
4. Authorize application access to Quickbooks.
   - Open Quickbooks and login to company file using the "Admin" account.
   - Run the console application.
   - If this is the first time the console application is trying to connect to Quickbooks, the QB authorization wizard will show up. Just follow the wizard and authorize the application.

If everything is configured properly, you should see the details on the export processes in the console application.

Note:

- When the "OutputFolder" setting is blank it will default to the desktop.
- When the "OutputFileName" setting is blank it will default to "item_inventory.csv".
- When an error occurs during the process, the details are written to the "error.log" file located on the console application directory.
